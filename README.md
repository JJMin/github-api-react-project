**github-api-react-project** is a visually pleasing arrangement of popular GitHub repositories that, based on the selected language tab, will update cards dynamically using live data that is fetched from GitHub using their [GitHub API V3](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

I wanted to practice using React, styling with Styled Components, and Flexbox layout knowledge by building this application and use an API to both fetch and render data dynamically.

This modern web application was initially set up using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).

A live demo can be found @ [github-api-react-project](https://github-api-react-project.netlify.com/).

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm install
yarn start
```

These commands will install package dependencies and starts the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits and you will also see any lint errors in the console.

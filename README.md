**github-api-react-project** is a small React application that uses the Fetch API to get real-time data on the most starred repositories hosted on GitHub using their [GitHub API V3](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

I wanted to practice my React skills using React.js library by building this application and use an API to both fetch and render data dynamically.

This modern web application was initially set up using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).

A live demo can be found @ [github-api-react-project](https://github-api-react-project.netlify.com/).

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

```
yarn start
```

This command starts the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits and you will also see any lint errors in the console.
